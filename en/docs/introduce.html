          <h1>ofa.js - Progressive Front-end Framework</h1>
<h2>What is ofa.js</h2>
<p>ofa.js is a progressive front-end framework designed to allow developers to enter the front-end development and usage process at the lowest cost. It provides a series of simple yet powerful tools and APIs to make front-end development more efficient and convenient.</p>
<h2>Purpose of Existence</h2>
<h3>Replace jQuery</h3>
<p>In many small projects, we may not need to introduce large frameworks like React and Vue, but prefer to use jQuery for simple front-end operations. ofa.js improves the API of jQuery and replaces many of jQuery&#39;s methods with properties, making ofa.js more suitable in many scenarios.</p>
<h3>Simplify front-end development and usage process</h3>
<p>ofa.js aims to simplify the cumbersome front-end development process. It allows developers to build front-end applications more quickly without the need to learn complex tools such as Node.js, npm, and scaffolding. With it, you can go back to the experience of just importing one library to develop.</p>
<h3>Become a Silver Bullet Front-end Development Framework</h3>
<p>ofa.js aims to be a &quot;silver bullet&quot;, capable of solving various front-end development problems and providing comprehensive solutions. It is not just a utility library, but a comprehensive front-end development framework.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Easy-to-use component development</h3>
<p>There is almost no learning cost for components developed using ofa.js. ofa.js provides a concise and intuitive API that allows developers to quickly create and integrate components while keeping the code clean and maintainable.</p>
<h3>Built-in modularization, state update, and application integration solutions</h3>
<p>ofa.js has integrated solutions for modularization, state updating, and application integration, allowing developers to complete complex front-end development tasks without the need for additional third-party libraries or tools.</p>
<h3>Officially provided routing and SSG (Static Site Generation) solutions</h3>
<p>ofa.js also provides official solutions for routing and SSG, helping developers better manage front-end routing and generate static websites to improve application performance and SEO friendliness.</p>
<h3>Compact code size</h3>
<p>ofa.js code has been carefully optimized, and the compressed .min file size is only 38kb (only 14kb under gzip). This makes ofa.js an efficient front-end framework that can be quickly loaded and used in various network environments.</p>
